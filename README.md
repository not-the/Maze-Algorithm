Maze generator and solver

**To-do:**
- [ ] Fix solver (visually) turning right into walls
- [ ] Remove duplicate code when speed is 0
- [ ] Generator: create a list of nodes that still have walls and move the carver there randomly. End when all nodes are carved. Node list can be created with the board and entries can get removed as the program runs
